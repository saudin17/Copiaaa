2. Basic Recipes
================

The following recipes demonstrate some of the capabilities of the GPIO Zero library. Please note that all recipes are written assuming Python 3. Recipes may work under Python 2, but no guarantees!

------------------------
2.1. Importing GPIO Zero
------------------------

In Python, libraries and functions used in a script must be imported by name at the top of the file, with the exception of the functions built into Python by default.

For example, to use the Button interface from GPIO Zero, it should be explicitly imported:

+---------------------------+
|from gpiozero import Button|
+---------------------------+

Now Button is available directly in your script:

+------------------+
|button = Button(2)|
+------------------+

Alternatively, the whole GPIO Zero library can be imported:

+---------------+
|import gpiozero|
+---------------+

In this case, all references to items within GPIO Zero must be prefixed:

+---------------------------+
|button = gpiozero.Button(2)|
+---------------------------+

------------------
2.2. Pin Numbering
------------------

This library uses Broadcom (BCM) pin numbering for the GPIO pins, as opposed to physical (BOARD) numbering. Unlike in the RPi.GPIO library, this is not configurable. However, translation from other schemes can be used by providing prefixes to pin numbers (see below).
